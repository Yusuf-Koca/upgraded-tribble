This GitHub repository contains three files with Python code:
1. *first_preparation_of_data* which contains the code of the first data preparation and exploration, right after finding the topic of our project;
2. *THE_CODE* which is the final version of the code we used for this analysis;
3. *statistics_only* which is a stand-alone file, containing a statistical analysis of our data, for the purpose of a more research-focused presentation during Machine Learning class.
